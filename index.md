The **Robotics, Sensing and Networks** Laboratory was established in 2005 with the goal of developing robotic systems which can operate in dynamic and complex systems. Such systems often involve multiple robots. For successful operation sensing and communication goals and constraints must be addressed. 

Our research methodology is two-pronged:

* Theory
* Systems

The RSN Lab is in the process of moving from the University of Minneosta to the University of Texas at Austin.

## Historical Note

In our 20th anniversary, we modified our name from _Robotic Sensor Networks_ Lab to _Robotics, Sensing and Networks_ Lab to reflect the broadening scope of our research.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
